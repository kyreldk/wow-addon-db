# WoW Addon git repo collection

Please help convincing the authors of major WoW addons to offer github releases and to collect the repository information about the ones who already do. 
This way, the community will be able to create a git based WoW addon manager.

# Contribute

- Make a pull request, adding addons or sources
- Encourage the developers of your favourite addons to use git / github
- If they are already using github, encourage them to follow a clearly visible release strategy to facilitate the creation of a git based WoW addon manager

**If the addons.json file is too large for your text editor, you can simply open an issue, telling me which addon and which repo, then I'll add it by myself.**

The goal of collecting this information is to be able to create a WoW addon manager based on git.
